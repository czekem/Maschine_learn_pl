ML_pl.py: A Polish Word Identification Tool

This Python script utilizes data from a Polish dictionary to identify words that start with the most common Polish letters: a, i, e, o, n, and r. It provides a user-friendly interface for checking individual words or analyzing a list of words.

Key Features:

    Identification of Polish words: The script efficiently identifies words that start with the most common Polish letters, enabling users to quickly determine if a given word is Polish or not.

    User-friendly interface: The script utilizes inquirer, a Python library for interactive prompts, to interact with the user and provide a simple and intuitive way to input words and receive results.

    Flexibility: The script allows users to analyze individual words or process a list of words, making it versatile for various tasks.

Usage:
Python

from ML_pl import MyClass

# Example 1: Checking individual words
words = ['gas', 'oil', 'water', 'chem', 'ala', 'ela']
for word in words:
  obj = MyClass(word)
  obj.check_and_append(MyClass.letters)
  print(obj)

# Example 2: Processing a list of words from a file
filename = 'words.txt'
with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
  words = f.read().splitlines()

for word in words:
  obj = MyClass(word)
  obj.check_and_append(MyClass.letters)
  print(obj)

Expanding the Script:

This script offers a solid foundation for further development. Here are some possible extensions:

    Implement a dictionary lookup: Instead of using a hardcoded list of common letters, integrate with a Polish dictionary to provide more accurate and comprehensive results.

    Analyze word endings: Add functionality to identify words ending with common Polish prefixes and suffixes, further enhancing the script's ability to assess Polish word structure.

    Integrate with natural language processing (NLP) techniques: Explore NLP tools to analyze word frequency, context, and grammatical structure for a more robust and sophisticated assessment of Polish word usage.

By incorporating these extensions, the script can evolve into a powerful tool for analyzing Polish language patterns and identifying Polish words within broader text corpora.
